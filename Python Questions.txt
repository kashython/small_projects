1. A semordnilap is a word or phrase that spells a different word or phrase backwards. 
("Semordnilap" is itself "palindromes" spelled backwards.) Write a semordnilap recogniser that accepts a file name 
(pointing to a list of words) from the user and finds and prints all pairs of words that are semordnilaps to the screen.
For example, if "stressed" and "desserts" is part of the word list, the the output should include the pair "stressed desserts".


2. A hapax is a word which occurs only once in either the written record of a language, the works of an author, or in a 
single text. Define a function that given the file name of a text will return all its hapaxes. Make sure your program 
ignores capitalization.


3. Encrypt a textual file by writing a function that will take an input a shift key, this will shift all the text characters 
by that key, decrypt function will do the reverse and restore the text.


4. Build a co-relation matrix for a textual file following the given steps:
	a. A page is considered made up of 40 lines
	b. Read the entire text and take a frequency count of the words, find the average and standard deviation of 
		the frequency count. Eliminate those words outside mean +/- 2 times the standard deviation, thereby 
		producing a list of important words
	c. For each page, now store the frequency count of these important words
	d. Return this matrix


5. Write a function to analyze textual file and find all valid phone numbers expressed as 10 digit number, replace them 
with India country code
e.g. 1224445566 should be replaced to (+91)-1224445566


6. Write a program to check for C and C++ style comments and eliminate them on a given C file


7. Write a program to check for C style
identifier tokens: cannot start with number, anything from alphabets and underscore
integer constants: can be +/- in the beginning followed by digits, zero,x/o/X/O,0-9,0-7,0-F depending on case
float constants: can be +/- in beginning, followed by digits 0-9, then e/E followed by at max 3 digit number


8. Write a program to check for a valid C style for loop, whose syntax is defined as 
for([statment1,statment2..statmentn];[statment1,statment2..statmentn];[statment1,statment2..statmentn])[;] [{ [statement1..statmentn]}]

9. The pigeonhole principle states that if a function f has n distinct inputs but less than n distinct outputs, there exist two inputs a and b such that a!=b and f(a)==f(b) . Present code to find a and b such that f(a)==f(b). Assume the functions inputs to be 1,2….n

10. If S is a set of n elements, the power set of S is the set of all possible subsets of S. For example if S=(a,b,c) , then power set(S)={(), (a), (b), (c),(a,b), (b,c),(c,a), (a,b,c)}. Write code to compute power set(S)

11. Magic Square : A magic square is a nxn matrix of integers 1 to n2such that sum of every row, column and diagonal is same. Following is magic square for n=5 where the common sum is 65.Refer Table 1. Following is an algorithm for generating a magic square when n is odd: Start with 1 in the middle of top row, then go up left, assigning numbers in increasing order to empty squares; if you fall off the square imagine the same square tiling in the plane and continue; if a square is occupied, move down instead and continue. Implement code that generates magic square for odd value of n using above algo.
